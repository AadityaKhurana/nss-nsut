# NSS NSUT Landing Page

This is a **responsive and modern landing page** for the NSS (National Service Scheme) unit of **NSUT (Netaji Subhas University of Technology)**.

## ðŸš€ Overview

- Built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** â€” no frameworks.
- Fully **responsive** across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Inspired by the official [NSS NSUT website](https://nssnsut.vercel.app).
- Lightweight and fast â€” no database or backend setup needed.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

Since this is a static site, there's **no need for backend processing** or database connections.

However, Iâ€™m also experienced in using:

- **Node.js**
- **Flask**
- **Django**

and can integrate server-side processing if needed in future versions.
